=========

Frequency analysis of orbital time series.

|Build Status| |coverage|

This is close to that implemented by Monica Valluri in `NAFF`_, which
itself is an implementation of the algorithm first used by Jacques
Laskar (see `this review`_ and citations within).


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is `available here`_.


Installation
------------

``SuperFreq`` is easily installed via ``pip``. To install the latest stable
version:

.. code:: bash

    pip install superfreq

To install the latest development version:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/adrn/superfreq

For the object-oriented interface to ``SuperFreq``, these are the only
requirements. For more automated frequency finding, youâ€™ll also need to
install `gala`_.
